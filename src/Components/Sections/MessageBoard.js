                                Welcome to Siliconera. We’re a site dedicated to covering interesting videogames and
                                all things related to them. We hold our community in high regard, and try to make it a
                                friendly, informative place for people. We achieve this by enforcing a carefully designed
                                set of rules, and ask that you adhere to them so everyone can have a good time.

                                <b>1. Read and think before you write:</b> If you intend to enter the discussion in the
                                comments, make sure to read the full article properly. Once you’re done, take a
                                moment to think about what you’re going to say. Are you discussing a subject you’re
                                well-versed in and have researched? If not, you’re probably better off not saying
                                anything. Are you being rude or derogatory? If so, you risk your commenting privileges.

                                <b>2. Keep complaints relevant:</b> During Siliconera’s day-to-day discussions, touchy
                                subjects often arise—localization or the lack thereof; physical and digital distribution;
                                company policies and system preferences; social issues and so on. If the article directly
                                relates to your concerns, feel free to discuss it in a civil manner. Don’t call people
                                names, don’t call people fanboys, don’t call people shills. If the matter is of such great
                                a concern to you that you can’t keep it civil or let it go, you’re better off talking to the
                                game developer in question directly.

                                <b>3. Don’t beat a dead horse:</b> Don’t like a particular game or company or issue and
                                really want to voice your thoughts? That’s fine. (See rule #2) However, once you’ve had
                                your discussion, let go. You don’t need to post the same comments about a game
                                in every new article once you’ve had your say. Don’t keep bringing the same
                                complaints up in every single post that is even slightly related to your concerns. Let
                                other people express their opinion for a change, unless you have something new and
                                interesting to add to the discussion.

                                <b>4. No begging for ports:</b> We’re sorry that “Super Awesome Game X” isn’t available
                                 for a your favourite console, but spamming the comments with “why isn’t this for
                                 NeoGeo Pocket” isn’t going to make it happen. DO NOT beg for ports or complain
                                 when games are announced systems you don’t own or don’t like. Platform choices are
                                 made by developers for a wide range of reasons. If you intend to argue with these
                                 choices, you’re better off talking to the developer in question directly.

                                <b>5. No posting GIFs:</b> Please refrain from posting GIFs. They take up bandwidth and
                                 resources, increase page loading times, often involve tired memes, add nothing to the
                                 discussion, and are a lazy way post a comment without actually saying anything.

                                community: (1) insightful and (2) welcoming. They take whatever measures they need
                                    to, in order to achieve this. <b>Don’t derail discussions to argue with the decisions of
                                the moderators, mock/berate them, or attempt to dictate how their job should
                                    be done.</b> None of the aforementioned will be tolerated and will result in an immediate
                                ban. If you have questions or concerns, a number of our moderators can be found on
                                Twitter. If you follow rules 1 – 5, you’ll never come under scrutiny in the first place.

                                -liners and cynicism to sound smart. Don’t be the guy that’s always complaining about
                                the same thing over and over again. Don’t be the guy that only plays games on one
                                console and complains every time other systems get great exclusives. Don’t be the guy
                                that’s close-minded and unwilling to entertain the idea that there’s more than one kind
                                of “gamer”.
